These methods now require invocation on an instance created by either `Artalk.init` or `new Artalk`. Please utilize instance-level methods instead, such as `artalkInstance.update`. For more information, refer to  [the documentation](https://artalk.js.org/guide/frontend/import-framework.html). The update was implemented to enable the concurrent creation of multiple instances, adapting to situations where Vue components are simultaneously referenced across various pages. Initially, only a singular instance was permitted to mitigate memory leak concerns. However, this proved limiting for scenarios involving the caching of multiple component instances through 'keep-alive.' To better suit intricate SPA application needs, the choice was made to permit the creation of multiple independent instances. It's crucial to remember to manually invoke the `artalk.destroy` method when releasing components to avoid memory leaks (Issue [#660](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/issues/660)).\n+\n+\n ## [v2.6.4](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/compare/v2.6.3...v2.6.4) (2023-10-12)\n \n ### Features"
