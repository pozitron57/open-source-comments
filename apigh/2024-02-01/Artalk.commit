You can refer to [#735](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/issues/735) or https://artalk.js.org/http-api Please update all your existing clients to adapt to the new v2 server. The new base path is `/api/v2/`. The UI package's HTTP client has been implemented to auto-generate based on `Swagger.json`, and there have been a lot of adjustments to the `artalk.ctx.getApi()` related code. In addition, the HTTP API no longer enforces checks on the header's `Origin` and `Referer` (to implement strict isolation of different sites) but still maintains the original CORS origin check.\n+\n+For General Users: Now all administrators have the same level of authority (there is no longer super admin authority), the function of assigning sub-administrators with independent scope authority to individual sites has been removed, which can simplify the HTTP server maintenance and implementation. Upgrading only requires updating the client and server application at the same time, and there are no additional operations.\n+\n+\n ## [v2.7.3](https://github.com/ArtalkJS/Artalk/compare/v2.7.2...v2.7.3) (2023-12-28)\n \n ### Features"
